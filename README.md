Has the pandemic made you a nervous homebody?
The fear of going back into the world is real during the pandemic is real.
Our old ways of living are now gone.
But your old favorites don't have to be.

Have you missed your favorite bar? How about your favorite drinks?
So have we.
With our Cocktail-Menu Webtsite you can search your favorite drinks and find easy to use recipes, from the comfort of your own home!
We even have weather based drink suggestions and the ability to save your favorite recipes. 
It is an amazing user friendly site to help those who want bar quality cocktails in the safety and convienence of their own home.

Our cocktail-menu website is a place to come to search your favorite drinks, get a drink suggestion based on your weather. It even stores your username information.

To create our webpage we used html, css, javascript, and bulma. Bulma is a free css framework. We did all our coding through vitrual studio code and created our repository using github.

We worked as a team but broke down tasks to create our ultimate website. Bret and Aaron worked to tackle the javascript while Cumar and Elizabeth coded the html and css, as well as worked with bulma. 
Bret specifically coded
Aaron worked on 
Cumar created
Elizabeth coded aspects of the html, created the css, formatted the colors, helped create the modals, and integrated bulma. She also wrote this README file. 


Challenges included not being able to originally implement tailwind due to having to pay for the full version, runnning into issues displaying modals and all the drink cards, strange css issues of elements not going where we coded them to go, displaying the weather, and last but not least our many, many challanges with git pulls. 

Successes encompassed our strong ability to work well as a team, we all supported one another. Bret's amazing code to display the drink cards and modals. Our user storage feature. General asthetitcs, and the fact that we have a functional website!

Direction for future development includes the aspect of saving favorite drinks for the user in local storage. We would like to have a site that users can feel like is geared towards them and takes their taste into consideration.
